1. What does this project do?
		This project is exclusively made for graphic designers in Handong. This 'DESIGN SQUARE' website is for students in Handong who major in graphic design and need improvements and more practice with their designing skills. DESIGN SQUARE lets graphic designer students to take design requests from other students in Handong. It can be poster design for personal use, club recruitments, school events, or other special occasions. Sadly, it cannot be 100% free, but since it's a place for practice and improvements, it will be less expensive than normal requests. It definitely is a win-win project for both designers and client.

2. Why is this project useful?
		This project is useful especially for graphic designer students of Handong and the client. It's useful because the graphic designer students get chances to improve and practice their design. Also for Handong students(clients), they can get good poster designs for cheaper prices (if the designer allows it). The clients do not have to struggle to look for designers. 

3. How to get started?
		If you're the designer, you can visit the website and fill out the recruitment form. Designers can submit their portfolio to show that they are capable of designing posters. If you're the client, visit the website and fill out the request form. That's all!
		
4. Where can people get more help, if needed?
		They can contact the staffs of DESIGN SQUARE for more information.
